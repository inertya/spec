[![CC-BY-SA-4.0][cc-license-svg]][cc-license-deed]

### TL;DR

[CC-BY-SA-4.0][cc-license-deed]. You may (commercially) share and adapt this
work, as long as you [provide credit][cc-license-code-s3a], and share the
resulting work under a [compatible license][cc-sa-compatible]. In practice,
this means all code based off of inertya (server & client implementations, 
plugins, etc) is licensed under the [GPLv3].    

#### Do Privately Developed (Closed-Source) Servers Have to Share/Publish Source Code?
**No.** This is specifically *not* the [AGPL][gnu-why-agpl].

#### What About Content Produced as an Output of an Inertya Implementation?
eg. Recordings (youtube videos), exported maps, etc.

Output content is **not** subject to the terms of the software's license.  
However, if that output content contains art/audio, it may be subject to the 
licensing terms of that art/audio. Although, in practice, art assets are 
typically licensed under [CC0] or [CC-BY].
