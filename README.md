## WIP

this project is a work in progress and something that i've had the idea for 
for almost 2 years. i'm currently trying to write a minimum viable 
specification, and then implement it in rust. feel free to have a look 
around, but i'm not exactly accepting contributions right now (when its done 
and i get settled i will).

if for some reason you do think this is interesting,
feel free to add me on discord (`Sky9x`) and we can chat :)
